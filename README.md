# Engineering Ladder Chart Builder

Engineering Ladder Chart Builder is an interactive tool for visualizing and customizing engineering career ladders as radar charts. It’s designed to be flexible, easy to use, and exportable—so you can define your own axes, levels, and labels, and save or share your ladders.

## What can you do with it?
- Change the names of axes and levels to fit your org or your own growth areas.
- Adjust values for each axis with sliders or number inputs.
- Drag any label (top-level or level) to wherever you want for clarity.
- Save your ladder as a JSON file, or load one back in.
- Export the chart as a PNG image for docs, slides, or sharing.

## How to use locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Why?
I was inspired by [jorgef/engineeringladders](https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders) and wanted a more visual, hands-on way to explore and communicate growth frameworks. If you find it useful or have ideas, feel free to open an issue or PR!
