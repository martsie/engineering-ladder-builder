# Engineering Ladder Chart Builder

This is a tool I vibe coded to help visualize and customize engineering career ladders as radar charts. I wanted something interactive, easy to tweak, and exportableâ€”so you can play with your own axes, levels, and labels, and share or save your ladders.

## What can you do with it?
- Change the names of axes and levels to fit your org or your own growth areas.
- Adjust values for each axis with sliders or number inputs.
- Drag any label (top-level or level) to wherever you want for clarity.
- Save your ladder as a JSON file, or load one back in.
- Export the chart as a PNG image for docs, slides, or sharing.

## How to use locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Why?
I was inspired by [jorgef/engineeringladders](https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders) and wanted a more visual, hands-on way to explore and communicate growth frameworks. If you find it useful or have ideas, feel free to open an issue or PR!
